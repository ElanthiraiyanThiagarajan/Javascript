 # Constant
    const = 10;
    If we assign any values to const we cannot able to modify the value,but we manipule in object.

 # DataTypes
    Primitive   
        String
        Number
        Boolean
        Undefined Type
        Null Type
        Big Int Type
        Symbol Type
    Non Primitive
        Objects
# Equality
    == (Allows coercion) 
    === (Does not allow coercion)

# Conditional Statements
    if 
    else
    else if
    switch

# Looping Code
    for
        for(initializer;condition;final-experssion){}
    while
        initializer
        while(condition){
            final -experssion
        }
    Do..while 
    for..of loop


 # Functions
    * A Javascript function is a block of code designed to perform particular task
        Ex : Add two numbers,Multiply Two Numbers
    * Functions are reusable as they can be defined once and can be called with different values resulting in different results.
    * Functions help divide a complex problem into smaller chunks and makes your program easy to understand and maintain
        function name(parameter1,parameter2,parameter3){}     

# Scope 
    Scope basically determines the accessibility or visibility of variables
    Block scope : Variable inside a pair of curly braces cannot be accessed from the outside block.
    Function Scope : Variable declared inside a function cannot be accessed from the outside the function.
    Global Scope : Globally scoped variable can be accessed inside a block or a function.
